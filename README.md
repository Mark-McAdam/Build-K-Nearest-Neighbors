Brute force approach is what I am writing. We can compare with SKlearns brute force version as well. The default algorith choice of 'auto' attempts to look at the data and decide on the best algorithm to use. 

Try my handbuilt method and time it completing two data sets
    Iris
    Cancer
     
    comparison of time with auto sklearn and brute force sklearn

    Sklearn can use a radius to measure only things close to a central point 
        Can I turn this on for a comparison?
